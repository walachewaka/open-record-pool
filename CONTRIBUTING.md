# Developer notes for Open Record Pool

## Version number
We follow Semantic Versioning 2.0.0.
See https://semver.org

When we do a release, developers should update the version number at the following locations:
- backend/openrecordpool/__init__.py
- frontend/ FIXME

Then, we update the CHANGELOG.md file with the release notes.
